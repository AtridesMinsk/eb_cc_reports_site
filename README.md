This is a website for reporting on CallCentre activity.

For the statistics generator to work, you need to create a connect_db.py file containing:

prod_host = "Your database address"
port = "database connection port"

user = "username to connect to the database"
prod_password = "password to connect to the database"

database = "database name"
